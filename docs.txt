need to:

set up express js server
use either mongodb or google firebase database to store the data (choose one or try both)

call apis and learn how to request them
    process them when u get them
        and learn how to use them
            the methods for them

store the data in localstorage aswell
    also be able to fetch data from localstorage
        and check if we have data from api in localstorage if not dont fetch it

can have a simple backend with a header and middle section for user to input small data

we are learning about apis in the way that we will use in our price project

    have basically have our express js backend server set up but its barebones.
        i need to figure out how to call the api from the backend server, request it on the front end and get that data to the front end and save that data somewhere

    we kinda got our backend working so it fetchs the data from api. then we call it on front end and console log it. we can now work with this data. we also can store it in localstorage and check if it exists, if not call the api from the backend.
        next is to work with it more. then set up mongodb and have our front end check our localstorage first, if not there check the mongodb database, then if not we can fetch from our backend, where the api is called.
